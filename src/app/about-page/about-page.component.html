                  In the today's gig economy, freelancers will quickly accumulate a handful of clients. Instead of having each client's info scattered
                  across notebooks, phone contacts, and email contacts, keep track of your professional life with Gig Journal. You can create seperate modules for
                   each client, with tasks, important events, and contacts.

                  the businesses or clients you deal with, and you will no longer be scrambling for contact info when it comes time to reach a past client.
